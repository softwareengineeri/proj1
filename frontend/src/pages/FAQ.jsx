              <Accordion.Body>
                While the digital assistant can provide general legal information and guidance, it is not a substitute for personalized legal advice from a qualified professional. For complex legal matters or specific situations, we recommend consulting with a lawyer or legal expert who can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
